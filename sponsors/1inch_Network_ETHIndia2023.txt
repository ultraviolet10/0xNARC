🪙 Build Innovative Solutions on top of 1inch Network's Token Plugins ⸺ $6,000

   ① $3,000       ② $2,000       ③ $1,000   
1inch recently announced new library that introduces an extendable and secure system for ERC20-based tokens. By subscribing an account to various plugins, users can dynamically enhance the functionality of their tokens. Technically plugins are a collection of smart contracts that track changes in ERC20 token balances and perform supplementary accounting tasks for those balances. They are particularly useful when you need to track, for example, token shares without actually transferring tokens to an accounting contract.
Try to hack using such library. That is it.
Criteria:
1 - Use https://github.com/1inch/token-plugins
2 - The utilization of token-plugins should have a meaningful purpose
