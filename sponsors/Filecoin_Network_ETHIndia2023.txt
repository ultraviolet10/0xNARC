Filecoin, the world's largest decentralized network offers more than 16+ Exbibytes of storage. It allows users to store, request, and transfer data via a verifiable marketplace. Filecoin is completely open-source, enabling people from all over the world to participate.
Prizes
?
?�Most unique projects in the Filecoin Ecosystem�?�$9,000
Best innovative applications or technologies building with Filecoin projects. Using one or several decentralized technologies from the Filecoin ecosystem qualifies for this track.
Qualifying tech:
? Filecoin: decentralized storage network, connecting storage providers and clients
?? Storage Onramps: NFT.Storage, Lighthouse.Storage
? Filecoin Saturn: an incentivized CDN for fast retrieval
?? FVM: the Filecoin Virtual Machine - a blockchain VM hypervisor - supporting runtimes
? IPC: InterPlanetary Consensus - next-generation scalability tech using trees of subnets
New Tech Breakthroughs ??
- we are also encouraging innovative breakthroughs using FVM and IPC
?? New FVM runtimes: Experiment on FVM, adding new execution runtimes. This could be existing blockchain VMs or components like zkEVM, fhEVM, CairoVM, MoveVM, or similar. Or this could be broader virtualization technologies like: Cloudflare Workers, Docker, or even FirecrackerVM.
? Large Scale Applications: Experiment on IPC, leveraging throughput properties IPC subnets and/or tooling to build large scale apps (games, social networks, and more). Ideas: build subnets for games (board games, turn-based games, or similar), subnets for computation (Compute over Data, programming pipelines, etc), or subnets with interesting FVM runtimes (see above).
?? Warning: this requires a lot of experimentation - there be dragons ?
Bonus points for building out project ideas unique to the Filecoin Ecosystem!
Qualification Requirements
All projects using Qualifying tech will be considered. Ideas that excited us:
?Programmatic Storage: Best solutions & tools built on/for FVM to enable programmatic data storage & retrieval, for data clients and/or storage providers on the Filecoin network.
?DataDAOs: Build meaningful DataDAOs & DAO tooling solutions on FVM to enable curation, use, storage, analysis, monetization, and/or governance of valuable datasets using FVM DataDAO starter kit.
?State/storage integration: Build services that retrieve, store and interact with small pieces of data on IPFS through FVM smart contracts. Bonus points for implementing storage and reward disbursement.
?DeFi: Best DeFi tools, services, or instruments built on FVM for token-holders & 3000+ storage providers (SPs) - e.g. liquid staking, SP pools, factorization, data insurance, SP insurance, and more.
??? New FVM runtimes: Experiment with new execution runtimes. (described more above).
?? Large Scale Applications: Leverage IPC subnets and/or tooling to build large scale apps (games, social networks, and more). (more examples above). You may need to run local nodes!
PS: IPFS alone does not qualify.
